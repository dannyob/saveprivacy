<p>
Recently the current Australian government has announced they are making plans to bring in new laws which undermine citizens internet privacy.
</p>
<br />
<p>
The new laws are a part of many ammendments made to the Anti-Terrorism bill and focus on stricter retention of citizens browsing habits.
</p>
<br />
<p>You can read more about the plans <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/digital-life-news/george-brandis-in-car-crash-interview-over-controversial-data-retention-regime-20140806-101849.html">here.</a> (Also includes a funny interview with the Attorney General)
</p>
<br />

<p>Stop The Spies is a grass-roots campaign to raise awareness and pressure policy makers into making better decisions about citizen privacy.</p>
<br />
<p>We are currently in the planning stages, and if you are interested in participating, please join in the <a href="https://github.com/stopthespies/website/issues">discussion on GitHub</a>.</p>
